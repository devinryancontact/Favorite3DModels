# Favorite3DModels
Created by Devin Ryan. Started on February 17, 2020.
This is a repository for images of my favorite 3D models I've made so far this year.

I made a New Year's Resolution to make at least 1 3D model every day of the year. By doing this, I hope to improve my skills in 3D modeling, improve my familiarity with modeling and animation software, and build a decent portfolio of my work.

All the models displayed in this repository were made solely by me, unless noted otherwise. Feel free to download and use the images as you see fit. They are being posted here to show the progression of my skills using Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max, Blender, and other software.

All images in this repository can also be found in my other repository: devinryancontact/DailyModels
